-   **Workflow Simulation:** Demonstrated a complete e-commerce lifecycle, from **secure authentication** to complex **cart operations** and **product CRUD management**.
    
-   **Role-Based UI:** Implemented **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure a tailored interface for both Buyers and Sellers, following modern frontend architecture standards.
